# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

Using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations you produce will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

# Results
The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities. The summary indicates the need for transportation and which part of the city utilizes transportation the most. Based on the dataframes, the Urban areas utilize the ride more than any other part of the city with 1,625 rides compared to rural areas at 125 and suburban with 625. Additionally, with that being analysis it proves the fare for urban rides are cheaper at $24.53 per ride along with more drivers being available in this area as well.

# Summary

In conclusion, I believe that it data provides an extensive amount of insight on the ride share base on the location in the city, as we see Urban riders make up most of the revenue. Most of the drivers in urban areas do not make as much as drivers in rural locations. The data shows all 3 areas have there own unique data and the fare amount differ in each areas, with the majority of ride share usage being in Urban areas.
